    <h2>Hobbies</h2>
<p>Outside of my academic pursuits, I enjoy a variety of activities that help me stay creative and balanced:</p>

<ul>
    <li><strong>Tech Exploration:</strong> I enjoy experimenting with new programming languages, building small projects, and contributing to open-source initiatives.</li>
    <li><strong>Photography:</strong> I love capturing moments of everyday life through photography. It's a creative outlet for me that allows me to pay attention to the finer details.</li>
    <li><strong>Outdoor Activities:</strong> I enjoy hiking and cycling as a way to stay active and recharge my mind.</li>
    <li><strong>Volunteering:</strong> I am passionate about mentoring young women in STEM, and I have volunteered at various events that encourage girls to pursue careers in technology.</li>
</ul>

<p>These hobbies not only help me unwind but also complement my career goals by fostering creativity, problem-solving, and leadership skills.</p>
