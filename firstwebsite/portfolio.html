            <h3>&#9733;"Vaccination Coverage Survey" with Médecins Sans Frontières-OCA
                <br>(Operational Center Amsterdam)
            </h3>
            <p>
                During my time as a refugee in Sudan, I had the opportunity to work with Médecins Sans Frontières (MSF)
                <br> on vaccination coverage surveys in a refugee camp. This experience not only deepened my understanding 
                <br>of healthcare in humanitarian settings but also allowed me to develop key skills in teamwork, resilience,
                <br> and communication. Despite the challenging environment, I was able to contribute effectively to the success
                <br> of the vaccination campaign.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Leadership and Initiative:</i></h4>
            <p>As part of the MSF vaccination coverage survey team, I took on leadership responsibilities within the field. 
                <br>I not only contributed to data collection and interviews but also took the initiative in organizing and
                <br> coordinating smaller teams for specific tasks. I led a team of data collectors, ensuring they understood 
                <br>the survey objectives, proper procedures, and the importance of maintaining ethical standards when interacting 
                <br>with vulnerable populations. My ability to motivate and guide others, especially in a high-pressure environment,
                <br> helped ensure smooth operations and the successful completion of our mission.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Teamwork and Collaboration:</i></h4>  
            <p>As part of the MSF vaccination coverage survey team, I collaborated closely with a diverse group of healthcare professionals,
                <br> fieldworkers, and local staff. Our team was composed of individuals from various backgrounds, and I quickly learned the
                <br> importance of effective communication and mutual respect. My ability to work cohesively with others was essential in ensuring 
                <br>smooth data collection, reaching remote areas of the camp, and addressing logistical challenges. This experience reinforced my belief
                <br> in the power of teamwork, especially when resources are limited.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Working in a Harsh Environment:</i></h4>
            <p>The refugee camp in Sudan posed numerous challenges, including extreme weather conditions, limited resources, and security concerns. Despite these 
                <br>difficulties, I was able to remain focused and dedicated to the mission. I was responsible for conducting surveys, interviewing families, and 
                <br>gathering vaccination data from individuals who often faced barriers such as fear, misinformation, or distrust of medical services. My resilience
                <br> and ability to adapt to the difficult environment ensured that we could gather meaningful data that would help improve healthcare delivery in the camp.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Adaptability and Problem-Solving:</i></h4>
            <p>Working in such an unpredictable setting required constant adaptability. Whether it was navigating logistical challenges, managing cultural sensitivities, or
                <br> adjusting to rapidly changing conditions, I learned to quickly adapt my approach to meet the needs of the community. For example, when faced with low
                <br> vaccination card availability, I found alternative ways to gather accurate information by building trust with families and caregivers. This adaptability 
                <br>and problem-solving mindset were crucial to ensuring that our surveys provided accurate and reliable data.
            </p>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Resilience in Overcoming Challenges:</i></h4>
            <p>The work in the refugee camp required not just physical endurance but emotional resilience. As a fellow refugee, I understood the difficulties faced by the community,
                <br> which allowed me to empathize with families and individuals we were helping. My personal experience as a refugee helped me connect with others and engage in
                <br> meaningful conversations, ensuring that people felt comfortable sharing vital health information. Despite the emotional and physical challenges, my ability to stay 
                <br>focused and committed to the mission was key to the success of the survey.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Strong Communication Skills:</i></h4>
            <p>Effective communication was essential throughout the survey process. I was often the first point of contact for individuals and families in the camp, explaining the purpose 
                <br>of the vaccination survey and addressing any concerns. I made sure to communicate in a clear, respectful, and culturally sensitive manner, ensuring that people understood
                <br> the importance of vaccination and the survey itself. My communication skills not only helped in gathering accurate data but also played a crucial role in fostering trust
                <br> between the refugee community and the healthcare workers.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Impact and Results:</i></h4>
            <p>The results of the survey provided valuable insights into vaccination coverage in the camp. Through the data we collected, MSF was able to identify areas with low immunization rates,
                <br> allowing for targeted vaccination campaigns and improved healthcare delivery. My leadership in coordinating the team, ensuring smooth communication, and managing challenges helped 
                <br>achieve these results, contributing to the betterment of healthcare services for the refugee population.

            <h3>&#9733;UNICEF -Health Promotion and Nutrition Support</h3>
            <p>
                In my role at UNICEF, I was involved in the MUAC (Mid-Upper Arm Circumference) screening process, primarily focusing on assessing acute malnutrition in children and pregnant women.
               <br> here's a breakdown of my responsibilities:
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;MUAC Screening:</i></h4>
            <p><b>Objective:</b> The MUAC screening tool is used to assess the nutritional status of individuals, particularly children under 5 years and pregnant women.
                <br> A simple tape measure is used to measure the circumference of the upper arm, and based on the measurement, we identify if the individual is malnourished
                  <br>  or at risk of malnutrition.
                  <br><b>Process:</b> I would conduct MUAC screenings in various community settings, such as health centers or outreach clinics, recording measurements to identify
                  <br> individuals with acute malnutrition (classified into different categories based on severity).
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Supporting Community Health Programs</i></h4>
            
            <p><b>Health Education:</b> After screening, I would educate caregivers (parents or family members) about the risks of malnutrition, the importance of proper nutrition,
                <br> and ways to prevent it, including breastfeeding practices, food fortification, and balanced diets.
                <br><b>Supplementary Feeding:</b> For those identified as malnourished, I would ensure that they receive appropriate nutritional supplements
                <br> (e.g., Ready-to-Use Therapeutic Food or Plumpy’Nut) to help address their nutritional deficiencies and stabilize their condition.
                <br><b>Referral Services:</b> If any cases were identified as severe or requiring advanced medical intervention, I referred them to the appropriate
                <br> healthcare facility for further management.
            </p>
            <br>
            <h4><i>&#8226;Monitoring and Reporting</i></h4>
            <p>I played a role in tracking the progress of the individuals receiving food supplements and ensuring that they were benefiting from the intervention.
                <br><b>Data Collection:</b> Recording MUAC measurements, tracking malnutrition rates, and other related health metrics were part of my daily duties. 
                <br>This data would then be compiled and reported to higher management to ensure timely interventions.
            </p>
        </div>
        <div class="experience-item">
            <h4>&#8226;Adaptability, Teamwork, and Communication Skills</h4>
        
            <h5><b>Adaptability:</b></h5>
            <p> The conditions in the refugee camp were often unpredictable and extremely difficult. With limited resources, infrastructure, and access to essential services like education
                <br> and healthcare, I had to constantly adapt to the environment. Living in such a setting required developing resilience and the ability to make the most of what little was 
                <br>available. Whether it was adapting to harsh living conditions, working with makeshift tools, or finding creative ways to share knowledge in the absence of formal education,
                 <br>I learned to quickly adjust my expectations and approach. My adaptability allowed me to make meaningful contributions to the community, even in the face of overwhelming challenges.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5><b>Teamwork:</b></h5>
                <p>In the camp, teamwork was not a choice, but a necessity. The close-knit nature of the refugee community meant that we had to support each other constantly. With no formal education system in place, 
                    <br>I collaborated with other refugees to organize informal learning groups where we could share skills and knowledge. This cooperation helped bridge the gap created by the lack of resources, allowing
                    <br> us to learn from one another. We worked together to create small communal spaces, share food, and take care of each other’s well-being. My role often involved coordinating these informal initiatives
                    <br> and encouraging others to contribute to collective efforts. The power of teamwork in such a setting became clear—without it, survival and mental well-being would have been far more difficult.
                </p>
                <br>
                <h5><b>Communication:</b></h5>
                <p>Effective communication was essential for survival and creating a sense of community. Without access to formal education, we had to rely on creative and alternative methods to communicate, share information, 
                    <br>and organize. Whether it was discussing food distribution, healthcare, or safety issues, I learned how to communicate clearly and empathetically in such a resource-limited setting. I also found ways to 
                    <br>communicate across language barriers, as the camp hosted people from many different regions and backgrounds. I often acted as a liaison, helping to disseminate information, translating for those who didn't
                    <br> speak the dominant languages, and ensuring that everyone understood their rights and available services.Living in the refugee camp and lacking access to basic  resources, including education, reinforced my
                      <br>understanding of the critical role adaptability, teamwork, and communication play in overcoming adversity. These skills not only helped me survive but also allowed me to contribute to creating a more supportive
                      <br> environment for those around me.
